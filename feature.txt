give me a summary of float data in the indian ocean

I attempted to provide a summary of Argo float data in the Indian Ocean. My initial attempts to fetch data for a 
large region and a long time period (2022-01-01 to 2023-01-01) failed due to timeout errors and a "FileNotFoundError".
This suggests that the data request was too large for the server to handle within the given time limit, or the 
specified data simply does not exist.

Subsequently, I narrowed the region (50°E to 80°E longitude, -20°N to 10°N latitude) and the time period 
(June 1, 2022 to July 1, 2022). This smaller query successfully retrieved data from 45 Argo float profiles. The 
temperature ranged from 5.03°C to 30.66°C, and salinity ranged from 34.13 to 36.47.

I then attempted to generate a global map visualizing the data quality of dissolved oxygen (DOXY), a key biogeochemical 
parameter. However, this attempt failed due to an error indicating that the 'ArgoIndex' object lacks a 'search_params' 
attribute. This suggests a problem with the tool or its configuration, preventing the generation of the data quality 
map. Therefore, a complete assessment of data quality for the retrieved data is not possible at this time. The summary 
is limited to the temperature and salinity ranges from the successful data fetch.



🔹 2. Interactive Web Maps

If you want an interactive element (zoomable map) for a website:

folium

Python wrapper around Leaflet.js (super popular for web maps).

Generates an interactive HTML map you can embed directly.

import folium

m = folium.Map(location=[latitude, longitude], zoom_start=6)
folium.Marker([latitude, longitude], popup="Here!").add_to(m)
m.save("map.html")


(Then embed map.html in your website.)

ipyleaflet (for Jupyter or dynamic dashboards)

More interactive in notebooks or dashboards.
