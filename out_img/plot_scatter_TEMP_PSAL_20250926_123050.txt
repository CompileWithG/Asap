This scatter plot, generated from Argo float data, illustrates the relationship between ocean temperature (TEMP, likely in degrees Celsius, on the x-axis) and practical salinity (PSAL, a measure of salt content, on the y-axis). The visualization reveals a strong positive correlation: as ocean temperature increases, the salinity generally tends to increase as well, and conversely, colder waters are typically less saline within this dataset. The key insight for a non-expert is that ocean temperature and salinity are not independent; they are closely linked, defining distinct water masses and playing a fundamental role in ocean density, stratification, and circulation patterns.
