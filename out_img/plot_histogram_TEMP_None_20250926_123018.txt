This histogram, derived from Argo float data, visualizes the distribution of ocean temperature measurements. The horizontal axis ("TEMP") represents temperature values, likely in degrees Celsius, while the vertical axis ("count") indicates the frequency or number of observations within each temperature range. The plot reveals a significantly skewed distribution, showing that the vast majority of temperature measurements are concentrated at the warmer end of the observed spectrum. Specifically, the highest frequencies occur between 20 and 22 degrees Celsius, with 9 and 10 counts respectively, making these the most common temperatures in this dataset. The key insight for a non-expert is that the ocean temperatures recorded by these Argo floats are predominantly warm, clustering around 20-22 degrees Celsius, with significantly fewer instances of cooler waters within the measured range.
